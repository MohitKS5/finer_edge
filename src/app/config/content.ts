    content: `FINER EDGE believes that the need of the hour is sustainable development. With increasing population and growing pollution, 
    we can’t ignore the ill effects of planning on the environment.<br><br>
    Thus, our urban planning takes care of the following:
  - Utilizing the present resources keeping in mind the future needs of the society, so as not to exhaust the resources.
  - It should not disturb the ecological cycle and hence preserve the environment.`,

    name: 'Sustainable Projects',
    content: `
  Sustainability is a fully integral facet of design; a basic value rather than an afterthought. Our approach thus equates sustainable
  design with effective, efficient design. Rather than getting by with less, sustainability means getting more from space, material,
  energy and resources. It means a healthier, safer, more productive and attractive workspace which can improve brand perception and
  even serve as a key tool in recruiting and retaining key talent. Ultimately, a well-designed sustainable workplace provides a positive
  return on investment.

  At FINER EDGE, the in-house GRIHA Evaluators and trainers, LEED Accredited Professionals and Green Mark Managers integrate with
  project teams to achieve targeted certification standards, to match clients' sustainable business goals.

  Our combined strengths in design, engineering, construction and sustainability, allow seamless multi-services integration via a
  single point of responsibility.

  By managing LEED certification of clients' premises, FINER EDGE registers, administers and delivers the highest LEED rating at
  possible within pre-defined budgets and without compromise to the clients' business or project objectives.
